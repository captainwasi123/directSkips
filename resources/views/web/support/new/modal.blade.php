                        <p> Please ensure you have read and understood the following terms and conditions.  </p>
                        <p>  By hiring a skip through 24/7 Direct Skips Ltd (either online at www.247directskips.com or by telephone on 0330 9125 247) you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the following. </p>
                        <h5> Brexit and EU Law </h5>
                        <p> It is acknowledged by both parties that the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 section 2 allows EU law, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR) to be retained in its entirety and have effect in UK domestic law after the UK has left the EU, but also means that the UK can amend or repeal any law in the future after the withdrawal date. If due to the UK exiting the European Union and a clause or condition in this contract becomes invalid or it conflicts with a law enacted after the transition period on the 31st December 2020, the invalid clause can be either cut from this agreement leaving the rest of the agreement valid and unaffected if the law has been repealed or it can amend the clause to bring it in line with current UK law reflecting the changes. </p>
                        <h5> Background </h5>
                        <p> 24/7 Direct Skips Ltd operates as a skip source and supply business, meaning that they organise skips on behalf of skip businesses who deliver the skip to the Customer. The Customer pays the Provider for the Service and saves time and money because they need only contact one centralised business. </p>

            <h5> Brexit and EU Law </h5>
            <p> It is acknowledged by both parties that the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 section 2 allows EU law, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR) to be retained in its entirety and have effect in UK domestic law after the UK has left the EU, but also means that the UK can amend or repeal any law in the future after the withdrawal date. If due to the UK exiting the European Union and a clause or condition in this contract becomes invalid or it conflicts with a law enacted after the transition period on the 31st December 2020, the invalid clause can be either cut from this agreement leaving the rest of the agreement valid and unaffected if the law has been repealed or it can amend the clause to bring it in line with current UK law reflecting the changes. </p>
